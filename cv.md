## About me

My name is Dima, I'm 18 years old, I'm from Belarus, but I've been studying in Poland for 3 years. I learned about programing a long time ago, there were many attempts to start studying, but all without success. My main goal is to learn something new. And what this goal will lead to I'll know later!
